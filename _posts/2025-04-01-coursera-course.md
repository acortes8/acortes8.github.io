Someone told me that Coursera had a seven day free-trial, so I wanted to try it out.

I found a Ruby course by Packt, that was made up of three sub-courses, that I thought would be nice to go through, so I did.

While Coursera doesn't actually let me "export" a certificate under their free-trial, I still enjoyed and felt that I learned from the courses.

Currently I'm reading through a Ruby book (*The Well-Grounded Rubyist*), that covered a lot of the same material. Even so, it was nice to go through the material again under a different medium of learning, in this case videos instead of reading. It definitely cements knowledge to go over things more than once.

My experience with the free-trial was nice, there was definitely other courses on Coursera that were also interesting to me. However, they were much longer courses in duration, making it less feasible to complete those within the free-trial's length.

While I cannot export the certificate to something like my LinkedIn using their linking tool, I could screen capture the course page and non-exportable certificate. 

Here they are below, and also a link to the book I referred to.
