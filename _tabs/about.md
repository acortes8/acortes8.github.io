Hello, and welcome to my personal website! 

My intention with this site is for it to be a combination of a professional blog and portfolio.

I mainly want to use this space to highlight the projects I'm working on and to document what I've learned along the way.

Every now and again, I may also make a tangential post about my hobbies.

I'm using Jekyll for this site, along with Chirpy, I will provide links to both below, they're both very interesting and worth checking out.

Visit [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/ "A static site generator")<br>
Visit [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy "A theme for Jekyll")


<!---
In a gist...

Jekyll is a static site generator, written in Ruby, that take any Markdown files I create and applies layouts to them to create this static website. 

Chirpy is a theme for Jekyll, providing me more features in its layouts. Such as the categories and tags that give me a great way to organize all my posts into appropriate topics, and the archive feature, which is great for an at-a-glance timeline of posts.

## About Me

My name is **Alejandro Cortes**, I live in Chicago and I'm looking for an **entry-level** position in Software Development.

My degree is in **Computer Science**, I graduated from Northeastern Illinois University, both with recognition on the Dean's List and with latin honors, specifically Cum Laude.

I have a deep passion for continual learning, which I credit to being an International Baccalaureate student when I was younger, which instilled me with that passion and growth mindset early on.

Currently I am focusing my energy towards **Ruby and full-stack web development**, purely because it interests me, **though I am quick to learn and open to other languages, stacks, and technologies**.

I want to leverage everything I've learned from my degree and projects towards new larger goals, especially collaboratively with others.

At the bottom of the sidebar are icons that link to my various pages and email, though I'll include them here as well.
